# Compilation
The final game should compile with: ghc --make Main.

Install the Gloss library using cabal.

Initial commits (prior to Main.hs) do not produce executables, but can be loaded in ghci for testing.

# Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome, but please try to follow these guidelines:

* Every commit adds a specific piece of functionality and is as localized as possible.
* To the extent that this is practical, every commit must focus on one Haskell language feature.
* Commit messages briefly explain what was done.
* Extensive temporary comments (they exist for a single commit) discuss stuff in more detail near the relevant piece of code.
* All commits compile without errors.
